        <p> Here we get a good overview of total web sales in the US. A quick glance tells us that a majority of our sales reside in
            3 states: California, Texas, New York. The density of these states where we have sales is very large. We can also 
            deduce that due to the high concentration of populations in these spaces that word of mouth was successful marketing here!
            This gives more evidence to speak on the quality of the product, along with the sales price is deemed to be affordable 
            and sustainable when compared to the market.

                    This horizontal bar chart gives us total sales for each state, supporting our hypothesis that California,
                    Texas, and New York are the biggest sales states. It is surprising to note here that Florida, while not seeming
                    very dense compared to the other states, is hot on the tail of New York in total sales!

                City net sales are even more interesting. While Los Angeles is the biggest money maker, as expected from above, Bozeman
                which resides in Montana puts this state on the map as a place with high revenue.

            Looking at the chart above we see the company had a decent start in the US bringing in close to a quarter million
            at the start of 2020. From there over the 24 month period we are recording, we notice several instances where sales
            dip dramatically. When we compare this data to April-October of 2021 Product Channel data, we see this conicides with
            the issue of top selling products production issues (selling out). This gives us more data supporting that although
            the company had a boost in popularity and sales, the lack of forecasting potential boom in sales caused loss in revenue
            due to not putting focus on increasing production of top selling products.

            Here we see that the company had great success with their flagship general health products.
            There has always maintained a consistent consumer success around these products where a majority of focus should
            always be maintained. With the addition to newer product types, the biggest successful introduction was based around
            immune and digestive health. We believe that the company should continue to allocate resources in producing and 
            advertising their immune and digestive health products to add to their flagship of improving your health.

                Again we see year over year, the introduction of the Elderberry product was a major success! Overall, 
                we do see some shrink on the flagship sales due to the new product, but the overall sales between the two 
                far surpasses what Vitamin D3 was doing alone. Focus on these top 10 products should be maintained going into 
                2022.

                    Here we can focus on what products have not done well. Excluding bundles or higher volumes of flagships 
                    we see that Vitamin B12 and Magnesium dont seem to be contributing to much and could just be causing 
                    the company loss with production and logistics. We recommend that the company take a strong look at these 
                    products to determine if they want to sink more funds into them, or continue to market their strongest money 
                    makers.
