                    Based on our data, 65% of sales for the two best selling products, were purchased through their e-commerce vendor, Amazon. After discussion with the Vitamin Ventures team, the wholesalers are an important aspect of their brand awareness and word of mouth marketing. We recommend that they still build these relationships, but the growth is not there based on the data. It has stayed stagnant and is unsteady.

                    Focus should be on growing the top 15 products. These contribute to 80% to their sales while the other 50 products only produce 20% of their quantity sales.

                <p> Even though the data shows consistent growth, we see dips and spikes every other month. After discussing this data with the board, Vitamin Ventures confirms that sometimes they will have to turn away orders based on supply chain issues. </p>
