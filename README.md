# Project Vitamin Ventures

@channel
Proposal Requirements – Orange Group
1.	Morgan created the repo for our project
2.	http://github.com/HotMochaNoWhip/Vitamin_Ventures

**Topic:**
Our goal is to analyze real historical vitamin sales data obtained from an actual company (to remain anonymous) to project future sales potential – overall, by product, and by vendor.  We will analyze sales growth using actual sales for calendar year 2020 and 2021.  Through this analysis we will determine how sales growth should be represented best i.e., by sales revenue, number of accounts, units sold, or other.  We will determine if an additional vendor should be added based on past vendor performance.  We will determine what the average customer spends and look for patterns.  We may use some type of regression analysis to project future sales.  We will model the performance and projections using Matplotlib and Tableau and display data charts where appropriate. 

**Tech Stack:**
* Python
* Postgres
* Matplotlib
* HTML
* Tableau

**Deliverable(s):**
* Upon review with teacher assistants this list can be expanded.
* Develop CSV files to house data which will then be imported to Python.
* Determine if we have all of the data we need to perform meaningful analysis
* Run analysis in python:
    * Sales trends from 2020 and 2021
    * Sales by vendor
    * Sales by product
    * Sales by customer
* Display data in meaningful ways (to be further determined as we get to know data):
    *	Tablular data tables
    *	Trend line plots
    *	Pie charts
    *	Product bar charts
    *	Customer reports

These Directives need to be further defined/established:  Make sure these can be broken down into issues.  What the final project will be (website, dashboard, analysis, etc).  What are the success metrics?

**Timeline**
*	Once the above data or scope of project is further defined we can begin making assignments and tracking progress.
*	Bring proposals to Office Hours for review.
*	Your proposals should be ready by Monday's class.
